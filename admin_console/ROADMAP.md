# Admin Console - ROADMAP

Based on the current status and the `README.md` file, here are the suggested next steps:

1.  Implement Product Management Screen: Create the UI for managing products, including adding, editing, and deleting products.
2.  Implement Inventory Management Screen: Develop the UI for tracking inventory levels, updating stock, and managing product variations.
3.  Implement User Management Screen: Develop the UI for managing users, including adding, editing, and deleting users. This will also require API integration with the backend.
4.  Connect to Backend APIs: Integrate the admin console with the backend APIs to fetch and update data for products, categories, inventory, and users.
5.  Implement Settings Screen: Create a settings screen where administrators can configure various application settings.
6.  Testing: Thoroughly test the application on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and functionality.
7.  Accessibility Improvements: Further improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels, managing focus, and ensuring proper contrast ratios.
8.  Code Refactoring: Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
9.  Documentation: Add more detailed documentation for developers, including API documentation and code comments.

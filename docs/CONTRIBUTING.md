# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Before Checking In Code
*   Conduct a self-review of your code for quality and standards.
*   Ensure all new functionality is covered by tests.
*   Execute the full test suite and verify all tests pass.
*   Address any compiler or static analysis warnings.

## Before Issuing a New Release
*   Confirm all "Check-In" activities are complete for the release scope.
*   Update the CHANGELOG.md with a summary of all changes.

> **Note:** Frequent, incremental check-ins are encouraged for ongoing work. A formal Release should be created only when a cohesive piece of functionality is complete. The CHANGELOG for that release must comprehensively document the full set of changes.

## Reporting Issues
Include:
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and inclusive in all interactions.
